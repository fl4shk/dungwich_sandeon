## Dependencies
To build the game, you will need a C++ compiler that supports C++20. 

For now, this game needs SDL2 and the C++ version of PCG Random.

When downloading the game, make sure you recursively grab the submodules of
this git repo, as follows:
* `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fl4shk/dunwich_sandgeon.git`
