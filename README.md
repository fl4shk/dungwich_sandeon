This is an (in-development) (traditional, procedurally generated) roguelike
video game for modern platforms (for some definition of "modern").

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) is a link to the
definition of "roguelike" being used here.

For now, this game needs SDL2 and the C++ version of PCG Random.
